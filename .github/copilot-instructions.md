# VS Code Extension: Time Trace Local

## Architecture & Technologies

- **VS Code API**: For extension integration and UI features.
- **TypeScript**: Main language
- **pnpm**: Package manager
- **vite**: Build tool
- **react**: UI library
- **vscode-elements**: UI components for VS Code

## Documentation

- Do not create additional documentation files if not explicitly asked.
- Only add comments in code files when necessary for clarity.

## Other

- If the question is about an error in the webview-ui ask for output from developer tools from the extension host.
- If anything is unclear, ask as many questions as necessary to clarify. When you do use clarifying questions please do not use bullet points but rather letters with each numbered question if the number requires bullet points.
- if you have to create a test script to verify the implementation, please remove it after the test is completed.
